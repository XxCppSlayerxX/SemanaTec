The project is a collection of 5 games developed in Python by the freegames library based on the turtle library for graphics, including snake, cannon, memory, pacman and paint.

The team included minor updates to the games, for example, making faster object and changing visual effects as well as documentating the code.

The project is useful because the code of the games is easy to understand and easy to modify making it perfect for learning through small practices in python.

To start using the project you need the freegames library, python3, and turtle libraries to run the code.

Users can get help with the project in the freegames website, and the turtles library documentation
